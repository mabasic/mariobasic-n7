I received an email from GitHub saying something about the "archive program" bla bla to push a commit to my repositories in order for them to be included in the program. I did not know anything about the program, what it is or what is its purpose, but somehow I opened the link and found out this:

_"On February 2, 2020, GitHub will capture a snapshot of every active public repository, to be preserved in the GitHub Arctic Code Vault. This data will be stored on 3,500-foot film reels, provided and encoded by Piql, a Norwegian company that specializes in very-long-term data storage. The film technology relies on silver halides on polyester. This medium has a lifespan of 500 years as measured by the ISO; simulated aging tests indicate Piql’s film will last twice as long."_

And then I skimmed on the next paragraph:

_"The GitHub Archive Program is partnering with Microsoft’s Project Silica to ultimately archive all active public repositories for over 10,000 years, by writing them into quartz glass platters using a femtosecond laser."_

I was/**am** excited! This means that the code I wrote (including this blog) will be preserved in the north pole for at least 500 years. Something like a timecapsule...

> I could use this blog to write down something for my grand kids 500 years in the future...

The purpose of the [GitHub archive program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/) is to preserve open source software for future generations, but I (like many others I suppose) have a far simpler idea:

Since I don't believe that I will live long enough to see 100 generations of my grand kids, here is a picture of myself and my daughter Sofia. She is my next generation.

**The cold vault will be updated every five years, so in the meantime I can think of something better to write for the future...**
