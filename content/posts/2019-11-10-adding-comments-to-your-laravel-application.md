<!-- **I've received an email yesterday letting me know that someone has created a YouTube video about my package laravelista/comments.** -->

I was a little bit skeptic about it all, since this is the first time that I know that someone has published a video about one of my packages. After verifying the link and seeing the video I was very happy and proud. The author of the video (Andre Madarang) explained the package, demonstrated how to use it, how to customize it, he even built a simple Vue.js component for displaying and posting comments with this package. As I was watching the video, I thought to myself **"I could not have done a better job myself."**. He really went step by step, took his time and explained everything correctly.

I've included the link to the video in the package [readme file](https://github.com/laravelista/comments#tutorials--articles) so that everyone can benefit from it.
