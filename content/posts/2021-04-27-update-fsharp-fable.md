I've rewritten Javascript with F#/Fable. After reading about F# and F#/Fable, comparing it with Rescript and Elm, and trying to find a project to experiment with it I have decided to use Fable and write Javascript with F#. My goal was to go all in and not write a single line of javascript. **It is all F# now 100%.** The code that I wrote follows the same structure as the JS code as much as possible. This was my plan so that it is easier for me to view differences. Parts of code could have been written better if I did not follow the code structure from JS as much.

Since I was/am new to the language I had to figure out a lot of stuff including the tooling, the ecosystem, the syntax, the libraries. The documentation for Fable could be better. There are so many options for everything. I had to find a React library, a JSON library and figure out how to do HTTP requests. There were times where I almost gave up on the F#/Fable rewrite.

~~For archive purposes I've kept the original JS files in the source code so that I can compare the syntax and code in the future.~~
